# This is the firt Project I've coded from someone else's design.
# At first, I have coded everything just with HTML,CSS and JS, but now
# I have updated it with Docker, React, Sass and of course Git.
# It was really interessting observing how much I've learned in just first two months of internship 
# My goal is always to update my code to be better as my knowlege grows
